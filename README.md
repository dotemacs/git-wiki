## git-wiki: even leaner version ##

Leaner version of git-wiki:

 * wiki & pages all in one repo

 * no **haml**, as **erb** is already part of the system, less to
   worry about when upgrading

 * all the pages directly under '/'

 * **maruku** for markup as it supports markdown extra

This is my version of git-wiki, which is a fork of Decklin Foster's,
which in turn is a fork of the original by Simon Rozet.

### Simple Install & Configuration

Execute:

     gem install sinatra grit maruku
     git clone git@github.com:dotemacs/git-wiki.git ~/wiki
     cd ~/wiki

Edit **git-wiki.rb**'s configure block and put your options in e.g.:

     configure do
       GitWiki.wiki_path = "~/wiki"
       GitWiki.root_page = 'Home'
       GitWiki.extension = '.md'
       GitWiki.link_pattern = /\[\[(.*?)\]\]/
     end

Run:  

     ./git-wiki.rb

and point browser to [http://localhost:4567/](http://localhost:4567/)
