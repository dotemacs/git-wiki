Welcome to your new [git-wiki][] wiki!

To create a new page, make a wiki link, [[like this]], then go there
and edit it. You can also commit files directly to the repository;
pages are stored as `page-name.text` (that is, lowercased, punctuation
removed, dashes for whitespace).

Formatting and external links are done with [Markdown][] & [Markdown
extra][]. To customize the appearance of your wiki, edit
`views/*.erb` and `public/wiki.css`.
